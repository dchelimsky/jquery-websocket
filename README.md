This plug-in is used to send and receive the JSON object directly with Web Sockets API.

NOTE: this is a fork of http://code.google.com/p/jquery-websocket/, which has many issues reported
but no activity in the code since 2010.

# Usage

## Connection

    var ws = $.websocket("ws://127.0.0.1:8080/");

## Sending Message

    ws.send('hello');                          // sending message is '{type:'hello'}'.
    ws.send('say', {name:'foo', text:'baa'});  // sending message is '{type:'say', data:{name:'foo', text:'baa'}}'

## Event Handling

    var ws = $.websocket("ws://127.0.0.1:8080/", {
        open: function() { ... },
        close: function() { ... },
        events: {
            say: function(e) {
                alert(e.data.name); // 'foo'
                alert(e.data.text); // 'baa'
            }
        }
    });

# Example


    <!doctype html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>WebSocket Chat</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>WebSocket Chat</h1>
        <section id="content"></section>
        <input id="message" type="text"/>
        <script src="http://www.google.com/jsapi"></script>
        <script>google.load("jquery", "1.3")</script>
        <script src="https://raw.github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/master/json.js"></script>
        <script src="https://raw.github.com/dchelimsky/jquery-websocket/v0.0.2/jquery.websocket.js"></script>
        <script>
          var ws = $.websocket("ws://127.0.0.1:8080/", {
              events: {
                  message: function(e) { $('#content').append(e.data + '<br>') }
              }
          });
          $('#message').change(function(){
              ws.send('message', this.value);
              this.value = '';
          });
        </script>
      </body>
    </html>

## Note on ECMA5cript 5 JSON API compatibility

Version 0.3 and below explicitly depended on the [jquery-json](https://code.google.com/p/jquery-json/) library to define the `$.evalJSON` and `$.toJSON` methods. This requirement has been replaced in subsequent versions by a dependency on the JSON parsing and serialization API defined in ECMAScript5 ([described thoroughly here](http://ejohn.org/blog/ecmascript-5-strict-mode-json-and-more/)).

When upgrading from 0.0.3, you must do one of the following:

1. Replace your usage of jquery-json with a library that defines `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify` for browsers that do not support them natively. json2.js from the [JSON-js](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) library is a good choice.
2. Provide your own implementations of those methods or otherwise deal on your own with browsers that do not support them natively.
